<p class="bold">TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</p>

<p>Original stage directions were usually in italic and placed in
parentheses ( ). A few inconsistencies&mdash;no closing parenthesis, use
of [ instead of (, no italic&mdash;have been left unchanged.</p>

<p>Stage directions were usually right-aligned with varying indentation
on the left, sometimes beginning on the same line as the dialog,
sometimes on a new line. This etext generally puts them on a new
right-aligned line(s) with an indentation on the left of several spaces.
They have been kept in-line with the dialog when it made sense to do so.</p>

<p>As noted under the list of <a href="#DRAM">Dramatis Personæ</a> ‘The
Passages put between inverted Commas are omitted in the
Representation’&mdash;meaning that this marked dialog was
omitted by the actors in the Theatre-Royal production
of the play. These passages are marked with <span class="omitted">a
small font and bold weighting</span> in this etext. The inverted commas
are shown as opening and closing double quotes: <span class="nowrap">“ and ”.</span>
Redundant inverted commas at the beginning of lines have
been removed.</p>

<p>The original text used the longform ſ, replaced here by the modern s.</p>

<p>The Table of Contents has been created and inserted by the transcriber.</p>

<p class="customcover">The cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Some minor corrections to the text are noted at <a href="#TN">the end of the book</a>.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Though to thank the Public is to thank
nobody, since no particular Person takes
this Sort of Compliments to himself, yet
were I not to feel that Gratitude, which
individually I know not where to pay, I were
unworthy of past, of present, or of future
Favours.</p>

<p>An Author’s Thanks to the World at
large may be seen under two very different
Aspects: For, to thank the Public is to tell
the Public he is successful; which, supposing
it true, it would be strange if they did not already
know; it appears therefore only to be
taking an Opportunity of indulging his Vanity:
And yet to thank them seems his
Duty, since his Silence might not only be
construed a want of Respect, but an arrogant
Self-confidence that, when they applauded or
approved his Work, they only did him justice.
The Reader must determine which of
these Faces he will please to view.</p>

<p>I am so well convinced that the best Writer
stands in need of Indulgence, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
only does well by Comparison, and might
do much better, that I shall find little Mortification
in subscribing to the Opinions of
those who shall tell me I am in this latter
Predicament.</p>

<p>Readers are divided into two Classes; the
one will allow an Author much more than
he merits, and the other much less; but
the principal Excellencies of <i>The Follies of a
Day</i> are so known to be another’s Right,
that for me to claim them would be ridiculous.
Some, however, have affirmed that it
is a mere Translation, who have never seen,
read, or heard the Original; if they had, indeed,
they would have been still more culpable.
Few will trouble themselves to examine
the precise Extent of my Claims; nor,
if they did, would they have an Opportunity
’till M. <i>de Beaumarchais</i> shall think proper to
publish <span class="smcap">La Folle Journée</span>. The Public
in general are so willing to overlook Defects,
and applaud wherever they can, that to complain
of, or be angry at the Few who seek for,
and wish to find, Errors only, can proceed alone
from that Self-love which is so inherent and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
irritable in all bosoms, and so difficult to
subdue.</p>

<p>To enumerate all the Obstacles encountered
and overcome in bringing this Comedy
on the English Stage, would be to indulge
this Vanity; which it is every wise Man’s
Pride, and every prudent Man’s Interest to
resist. It may, however, afford some Pleasure
to be informed, that, finding it impossible
to procure a Copy of the original French,
though a Journey to Paris was undertaken
expressly for that Purpose, the Copy made
use of in the composing <i>The Follies of a Day</i>,
was taken by Memory, only, during eight or
nine Representations; that I furnished the
Plot, Incidents, Entrances, and Exits, and
gave some other occasional Hints; that the
remainder was the Work of a young Frenchman,
whose Talents and whose Heart are
an Ornament and an Honour to his Country;
and that, after it was brought to <i>England</i>
and received by Mr. <i>Harris</i>, it was
translated, cast, copied, recopied, studied,
and, in one of its longest Parts, re-studied,
and played in little more than a Month.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
The Attention and Care of Mr. <i>Harris</i>, and
the Merits of the respective Performers in
playing, as they did, under such Circumstances,
need not my Encomiums. Had the
Town known the peculiar Exertions, of those
especially who performed the longest and most
essential Parts, the applause would have been
endless. From me they are justly entitled to
my warmest and sincerest Thanks.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Ah, Susan, Good morrow&mdash;Is my lord

<p><i>Susan.</i> Here! What should he be here for?</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Nay, there would be no miracle in it
if he were: would there, hey gentle Susan?
(<i>Smiles and leers at her.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> It would be a greater miracle to see
you honest.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Figaro is in search of him.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Then he is in search of the man who
wishes most to injure him&mdash;yourself excepted.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> It is strange, that a man should injure
the Husband by obliging the Wife.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>The Count peeps from behind the great chair.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> I shall hear, now, how well he pleads my
cause.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> For my part, Marriage being, of all serious
things, the greatest Farce, I imagined&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> All manner of wickedness.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> That though you are obliged to fast to-day,
you might be glad to feed to-morrow, grace
being first duly said.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Be gone, and do not shock my ears with
your vile principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Yes, my pretty Susan, but you must not
suppose I am the dupe of these fine appearances.
I know it isn’t Figaro who is the great obstacle
to my Lord’s happiness, but a certain beardless
Page, whom I surprised here, this morning, looking
for you as I entered.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> I wish you would be gone, you wicked&mdash;Devil.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Wicked Devil! Ah, one is a wicked Devil
for not shutting one’s eyes.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> I wish you would be gone, I tell you.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Was it not for you that he wrote the
Song, which he goes chanting up and down the
house, at every instant?</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> O yes! For me, to be sure!</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> At least it was either for you, or your
Lady.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> What next?</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Why really, when he sits at table, he does
cast certain very significant glances towards a
beauteous Countess, who shall be nameless&mdash;But
let him beware! If my Lord catches him at his
tricks, he’ll make him dance without music.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Nobody, but such a wicked creature as
you, could ever invent such scandalous tales, to
the ruin of a poor Youth, who has unhappily
fallen into his Lord’s disgrace.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I invent! Why it is in every body’s
mouth.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>The Count discovers himself, and comes forward.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> How! In every body’s mouth!</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Zounds.</p>

here to seduce her favourite woman!
I, however (<i>turning towards Basil</i>) shall not
suffer Figaro, a man&mdash;whom&mdash;I <i>esteem&mdash;sincerely</i>&mdash;to
fall the Victim of such deceit&mdash;Did he enter
with you, Basil?</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> No, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> There is neither Victim nor deceit in the

<p><i>Susan.</i> Knowing that you were angry with him,
the poor Boy came running to me, begging me to
solicit my Lady in his favor, in hopes she might
engage you to forgive him; but was so terrified,
as soon as he heard you coming, that he hid himself
in the great Chair.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> A likely story&mdash;I sat down in it, as soon

<p><i>Countess.</i> Well, but the Count, Figaro?</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Permit me, Madam, to manage him&mdash;And
first, the better to secure <i>my</i> property, I shall
begin by making him dread the loss of <i>his own</i>.&mdash;<span class="omitted">“Oh,
what pleasure shall I have in cutting out
Employment for him during the whole day!&mdash;To
see him waste that time in jealously-watching
your conduct, Madam, which he meant to
employ in amorous dalliance with my sweet
Bride&mdash;To behold him running here and there
and he does not know where, and hunting a monstrous
Shadow, which he dreads to find, yet longs
to grasp.”</span></p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Surely, Figaro, you are out of your
wits.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Pardon, my dear Lady, but it is your
good Lord who will soon be out of his wits.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> But as you know him to be so jealous,
how will you dare?&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Oh, Madam! Were he not jealous, my
scheme would not be worth a doit: but it will now
serve a double purpose&mdash;The Jewel which Possession
has made him neglect, will again become
valuable, if once he can be brought to dread its
loss.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> To confess the truth, Figaro, your
project exactly corresponds with the one I meant
to practise&mdash;An anonymous Letter must be sent,
informing him, that a Gallant, meaning to profit
by his neglect&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> And absence&mdash;is at present with his
beauteous Countess&mdash;&mdash;The thing is already done,
Madam.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> How!&mdash;Have you dared to trifle thus
with a Woman of Honor?</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Oh, Madam, it is only with a Woman of
Honor I should presume to take a liberty like this;
least my Joke should happen to prove a Reality.</p>

<p><i>Countess</i> (<i>Smiles</i>). You don’t want an agreeable
excuse, Figaro.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> The hour of performing the marriage
Ceremony will arrive post haste&mdash;he will be disconcerted,
and having no good excuse ready, will
never venture in your presence, Madam, to oppose
our union.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> But if he <ins class="corr" id="tn-29" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'will not, Marcellina'">
will not, Marcelina</ins> will; and
thou wilt be condemned to pay&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Poh! Thou hast forgot the Count is our
Judge!&mdash;And, after being entrapp’d at the rendezvous,
will he condemn us, thinkest thou?&mdash;But
come, come, we must be quick&mdash;I’ll send the Page

Antonio presents his Niece to the Count; Susan kneels,
one of the Bridemaids gives the Count the nuptial Cap;
and Susan, while the Count is placing it on her head,
plucks him by the cloak, and shews him the Note she
had just before written. He pretends to keep adjusting
the Cap, and slily reaches to take the Note, which he
instantly claps in his bosom, having previously unbuttoned
himself for that purpose. While this is transacting
a Castanet-Dance is performed. As soon as Susan
rises, she purposely places herself before the Countess,

steps forward, is going to open it, and pricks his

Why, what a Destiny is mine&mdash;Am I for ever
doom’d to be the foot-ball of Fortune?&mdash;Son of
I knew not who, stol’n I knew not how, and
brought up to I knew not what, lying and thieving
excepted, I had the sense, tho’ young, to
despise a life so base, and fled such infernal Tutors.
My Genius, tho’ cramp’d, could not be
totally subdued, and I spent what little time
and money I could spare in Books and Study.
Alas! it was but time and money thrown away.
Desolate in the world, unfriended, unprotected,
my poor stock of knowledge not being whip’d
into me by the masculine hic hæc hoc hand of
a School-master, I could not get Bread, much
less Preferment.&mdash;&mdash;Disheartened by the failure
of all my projects, I yet had the audacity to attempt
a Comedy, but as I had the still greater
audacity to attack the favorite Vice of the favorite
Mistress, of the favorite Footman of the
favorite Minister, I could not get it licensed.&mdash;It
happened about that time, that the fashionable
Question of the day was an enquiry into the real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
and imaginary Wealth of Nations; and, as it is not
necessary to possess the thing you write about, I,
with lank Cheeks, pennnyless Purse, and all the
simplicity of a Boy, or a Philosopher, freely described
the true causes of national Poverty: when suddenly
I was awaken’d in my bed at Mid-night, and
entrusted to the tender care of his Catholic Majesty’s
Mirmidons, whose Magic-power caused
the heavy gates of an old Castle to fly open at
my approach, where I was graciously received,
lodged, and ornamented, according to the
fashion of the place, and provided with Straw,
and Bread, and Water gratis. My ardor for
Liberty sufficiently cool’d. I was once more turned
adrift into the wide World, with leave to provide
Straw and Bread and Water for myself.&mdash;On
this my second birth, I found all Madrid
in Raptures, concerning a most generous Royal
Edict, lately published, in favor of the Liberty of
the Press: and I soon learnt, that, provided I
neither spoke of the Wealth of Nations in my
writings, nor of the Government, nor of Religion,
nor of any Corporate-Companies, nor offended
the favorite Mistress of the Minister’s favorite
Footman, nor said any one thing which could
be twisted into a reference, or hint, derogatory to
any one Individual, who had more powerful friends
than I had, I was at liberty to write, freely, all,
and whatever I pleased, under the inspection of
some two or three Censors!&mdash;&mdash;Soon after this,
a Place happened to be vacant, which required
a person well acquainted with Calculation; I
offered my Services; my Abilities were not questioned;
I waited, in anxious expectation of the Event,
and, in three days, learnt it had been bestowed,
two days before, upon a Dancing-master.&mdash;Persecuted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
by Creditors, tired of starving, and
unable, through the feebleness of Youth to sustain
so unequal a Struggle, I had the weakness,
at last, to sink before Temptation, and set
up a Pharaoh Bank. And now, for once, behold
the Scene changed! See me equally familiar
with Lords as with their Lacquies! Every door was
open to me! Every hand held out! But, notwithstanding
my desire to be Something in this world,
my detestation of the brazen Effrontery, profound
Ignorance, and insupportable Insolence of
these fashionable Friends of Nobility was so innate
that I found I could better endure all the Miseries
of Poverty than the Disgrace and Disgust of such
Society.&mdash;Quitting, therefore, with contempt this
new Trade, and leaving false Shame behind me, as
a burthen too heavy for a Foot-passenger, I once
more took up my strap and hone, and travelled
for employment from Town to Town.&mdash;&mdash;At
Seville I found a Lord mad to marry his Mistress;
my Wit procured him what his could not,
a Wife; and, in return, he gratefully endeavours
to Seduce mine&mdash;Strange concatenation of circumstance!
My Parents all at once claim me!&mdash;’Tis
he, ’tis she, ’tis me, ’tis&mdash;I don’t know
who!&mdash;I came into the world without my
Knowledge, and I shall go out on’t without my
Will; and thus do I continue to torment myself
about this Being of mine, without understanding
what this Being is, what it was, what
it shall be, whence it came, where it is, or whither
it shall go.&mdash;I only know it to be a compound
of Contradictions! A little, wise, foolish
Animal, ardent in the pursuit of Pleasure, capricious
through Vanity, laborious from Necessity, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
indolent by Choice. After having exhausted
every Art for enjoyment, and every Profession
for a livelihood, I found myself intoxicated by a
heavenly Illusion, that has vanish’d at my
approach!&mdash;Vanished!&mdash;And is it vanish’d?”</span>&mdash;Oh

<p><i>Count.</i> Come forth, Madam! (<i>Enters the Pavilion.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Which of these two has made a&mdash;Gentleman
of the other.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Perhaps neither.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> (<i>In the Pavilion.</i>) Come forth, I say,
shew yourself. (<i>Enter, dragging out the</i> PAGE,
<i>still speaking, and not looking at him till he gets on a
line with the rest of the Company</i>.) Happily, Madam,
there is no Pledge of a Union, now so justly detested.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> The Page!</p>

<p><i>Guzman.</i> (<i>After all the rest.</i>) The Pa-a-age!</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Again! And again! And everlastingly this
damn’d, diabolical Page. (<i>Page flies to the other side
of the stage.</i>) You shall find, however, he was not
alone.</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> Ah, no! My lot would have been hard
indeed then.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Enter Antonio, and drag the guilty Thing
before her Judge.</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> (<i>In the Pavilion.</i>) Come, Madam, you
must come out; I must not let you go since my
Lord knows you are here.</p>


<div class="blockquotxx">

<p><i>Enter with his Daughter</i>, AGNES.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Agnes!</p>

<p><i>Guzman.</i> A-A-Agnes!</p>

<p><i>Antonio.</i> Odzooks, my Lord, its a pleasant Trick,
enough, to send me in, before all these good Folks,
for my Daughter.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> I’ll find her, I warrant. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> (<i>Stopping the Count.</i>) Pardon me, my
Lord, but you are too angry at present; let me go.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit Doctor to the Pavilion.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Guzman.</i> This Cause is very perplex’d.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> (<i>Entering with Marcelina.</i>) Fear nothing,
Madam, fear nothing.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Marcelina!</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> My Mother too! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Where then is this Daughter of Infamy
thus evades my just Fury?</p>


<div class="blockquotxx">

<p><i>Enter</i> SUSAN, <i>with her Fan before her face</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Here she comes, at last; bearing her own Shame
and my Dishonour. (<i>Susan kneels to him, still hiding
her Face.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Pardon, pardon, gracious Lord!</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> No! No! No! (<i>They all fall on their knees.</i>)
No! No! Were the World to kneel I would be
deaf.</p>


<div class="blockquotxx">

<p><i>Enter the</i> COUNTESS <i>from the Pavilion on the
right, and kneels to the Count, whose back is turned
to her</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Countess.</i> At least I will make one of the Number.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Susan drops her fan, the Count hears the voice
of the Countess, looks round, and suddenly conceives the
whole Trick they have been playing him. All the Company
burst into a laugh: the Count’s shame, confusion, &amp;c.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Guzman.</i> (<i>Laughing stupidly</i>) Ha! ha! ha! ha!
’Tis the Countess!</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> (<i>With great humility.</i>) And&mdash;is it you my
Lady?</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> (<i>Inclines her body in token of Affirmation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> (<i>Returning her bow with great confusion.</i>)
Ah!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;Yes! A generous pardon&mdash;tho’ unmerited.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Were you in my place, you would
exclaim, No! No! No! But I grant it without a
single Stipulation.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> And I.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> And I.&mdash;There are Echoes here.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> (<i>Surprised</i>) I perceive&mdash;I perceive&mdash;&mdash;I
have been rightly served.</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> Here, Susan, here is the Purse and
Ring, which my Lord gave thee. He will remember
thy sweet delicate Fingers, so long and so small.</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Thank your Lordship&mdash;Here Figaro.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Gives him the Purse.</i></p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> It was devilish hard to get at&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> (<i>To Susan</i>) And the Letter you wrote&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Was dictated by my Lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p><i>Count.</i> (<i>Smiling good naturedly.</i>) Well, well! I am
an Answer in her Debt.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Thus every Man shall have his own.</p>

<p><i>Bounce.</i> And shall we throw the Stocking?</p>

<p><i>Countess.</i> There is the Garter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>Throws down the
Riband Hannibal had stolen in the Morning; Bounce

<p><i>Page.</i> This is my Right, and if any one dare
dispute it with me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Indeed! Mr. Officer&mdash;So bold a Champion
already!&mdash;Pray how did your Valour like the
Box on the Ear I gave you just now?</p>

<p><i>Page.</i> (<i>With his Hand to his Sword</i>) Me! My
Colonel?</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Which I kindly received.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> Thou!</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> I&mdash;And thus do the Great distribute Justice.</p>

<p><i>Count.</i> (<i>laughing</i>) Well, Mr. President, (<i>Don
Guzman instantly calls up all his Wisdom on finding
himself addressed</i>) what do you think of all these
things?</p>

<p><i>Guzman.</i> Thi-ink, my Lord? (<i>Considers</i>) I&mdash;I
think that&mdash;I do-o-on’t know what to think.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> I think, a few such Days as this would
form an excellent Ambassador&mdash;But lately I was a
poor, deserted, solitary Being, in this wide World,
and now I have Gold, Relations, and a handsome
Wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> And Friends will flock in abundance.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Do you think so?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Oh I know so.</p>

<p><i>Figaro.</i> Well, let them, they shall be welcome to
all I have&mdash;My Wife and my Wealth excepted.</p>
